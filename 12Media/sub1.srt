1
00:00:03,958 --> 00:00:09,208
A long time ago we left our home

2
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:16,583
But the home never left our hearts

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,292
Home dwells in every heartbeat

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:29,000
Till the last breath departs

5
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:38,667
Swear on grandma!
You'll never think of going to England.

6
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,458
Idiots! Why always swear in my name?

7
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:46,750
I, Buggu Lakhanpal, swear,
if I ever think of going to London...

8
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:49,125
my grandma dies.

9
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:52,375
May the departed rest in peace.

10
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:21,542
My only family is these four stubborn fools,
who want to go to London.

11
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:23,833
One of them is a lady, Manu.

12
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,958
I'll name our firstborn after you.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,292
What's your name?

14
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:32,125
Van-gi-pu-ra-pu Ven-kata Ku-ppu.

15
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:34,792
Can you write it down, sir?

16
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,167
Consider it done.
