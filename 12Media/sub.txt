A long time ago we left our home

But the home never left our hearts

Home dwells in every heartbeat

Till the last breath departs

Swear on grandma!
You'll never think of going to England.

Idiots! Why always swear in my name?

I, Buggu Lakhanpal, swear,
if I ever think of going to London...

my grandma dies.

May the departed rest in peace.

My only family is these four stubborn fools,
who want to go to London.

One of them is a lady, Manu.

I'll name our firstborn after you.

What's your name?

Van-gi-pu-ra-pu Ven-kata Ku-ppu.

Can you write it down, sir?

Consider it done.
